Jakub Jirutka <https://github.com/jirutka[@jirutka]>

This tool shifts UIDs/GIDs of directory entries recursively by some offset.
Itâ€™s designed for converting privileged LXC containers to unprivileged and vice versa.

This is basically a reimplementation of http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Eserge-hallyn/+junk/nsexec/view/head:/uidmapshift.c[uidmapshift] from http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/+junk/nsexec[nsexec] in Lua.
